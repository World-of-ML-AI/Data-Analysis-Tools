# Data-Analysis-Tools

A data scientist must be a good data analyzer also. This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for all the tools one need to perform Data Analysis such that Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and also some sample case studies are also included. We have included Exploratory Data Analysis on very famous datasets like the IPL Matches Dataset, Superheroes Dataset, FIFA Players Dataset from Kaggle and also Iris Dataset by University Of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

<p>
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
